4- What is the difference between a live connection and an Extract

ANSWER:
Live Connection, directly connects to the data source and updates in real time. It is useful when working with frequently changing data.

Dimensions are qualitative data that define categories. These fields are typically non- numeric and used for segmentation
On the other hand, Measures are quantitative data that can be aggregated. Measures are used for numerical analaysis

6- What is a Calculated field?

ANSWER:

These fields can be used for custom calculations, aggregations, or logic-based outputs

7- what is a parameter in Tableau?

ANSWER:
A Parameter is a dynamic input control that allows users to modify values in calculations, filters, and visualizations.
Unlike filters, parameters are not directly linked to data fields and require calculated fields or reference lines

8- what are filters in Tableau? Name the different types?

ANSWER:
Filters in Tableau allow users to control the data displayed in a visualization
- Extract Filters – Filters data while creating an extract.
- Data Source Filters – Filters data before it reaches the workbook.
- Context Filters – A primary filter that affects other filters.
- Dimension Filters – Filters categorical fields (e.g., filtering by region).
- Measure Filters – Filters numeric values (e.g., filtering sales > 1000).
- Table Calculation Filters – Filters data after table calculations are applied.

ANSWER:
A hierarchy is used to drill down into different levels of data.
Steps to create a hierarchy:

Drag one dimension (e.g., State) onto another dimension (e.g., Country).
Rename the hierarchy if needed.
Expand or collapse the hierarchy in the visualization using the + symbol.

Inner Join – Returns only matching records between two tables.
Left Join – Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right.
Right Join – Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left.
Full Outer Join – Returns all records from both tables, filling in nulls where no match exists.
