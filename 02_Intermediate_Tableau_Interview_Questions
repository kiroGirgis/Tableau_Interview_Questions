Intermediate Tableau Interview Questions
As you advance in your Tableau skills, you’ll need a deeper understanding of data manipulation, interactivity, and performance optimization.
The Intermediate Tableau Interview Questions section delves into more complex topics such as context filters, table calculations, data blending, dual-axis charts, and Level of Detail (LOD) expressions.
Mastering these concepts allows you to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that provide deeper business insights. 
Employers seek candidates who can not only build visualizations but also optimize data structures, enhance dashboard performance, and make strategic use of Tableau’s advanced filtering and calculation features.

1- Explain the difference between Context filters and regular filters?

ANSWER:
Regular Filters are filters that work independently and are applied to the entire dataset. If multiple filters exist, Tableau processes them in the order they were added.
On the other hand, Context Filters: these are higher -priority filters that determine a subset of data, which is then used by other filters. They improve performance by reducing the amount of data being processed.

2- What is the difference between a discrete and continous field?

ANSWER:
Discrete Fields: represent categorical data and create headers in visualizations.
On the other hand, Continuous fields: represent numerical or date data and create axes.

3- What is a blended data source, and how is it different from joins?

ANSWER:
Blended Data Source: conbines data from two separate data sources (SQL database + Excel) by linking them based on a common field.
It maintains data separation but allows cross-source analysis. On the other hand, Joins comnine tables within the same data source by merging records based on a common key.

4- How do you create a Dual-Axis chart in Tableau?

ANSWER:
A Dual-Axis Chart allows two different measures to be plotted on the same chart with separate axes
Steps
- Drag the first measure to the Rows or Columns shelf.
- Drag the second measure to the same shelf (it will create a second chart)
- Click on the second measure's dropdown and select "Dual-Axis"
- Synchronize axes if needed

5- What are Table calcualtions, and when would you use them?

ANSWER:
Table Calculations are computed after aggrgations and work within the visualization's scope
Common Table Calculations:
- Running Total: Accumulative sum of a measure's
- Percent of Totla: Computes a measure's percentage of the total
- Difference: Computes the difference from a previous row
- Moving Average: Smoothes out fluctuations in data.

6- What is LOD(Level of Detail in Tableau? Name its types

ANSWER:
LOD expressions control thge level at which calculations are performed, independent of the visualization's granualarity

FIXED: Ignores visualization filters and computes at a specified level.
INCLUDE: Includes additional dimensions in aggregation.
EXCLUDE: Ignores specific dimensions in calculation.

7- What are actions in Tableau, and how do they improve interactivity?

ANSWER:
Actions allow users to interact with a dashboard dynamically
Types of Actions:
Filter Action – Clicking one chart filters another.
Highlight Action – Highlights related data points across charts.
URL Action – Opens a URL when a user interacts with a visualization.

8- How do you optimize the performance of a Tableau dashboard?

ANSWER:
Ways to improve performance:

Use Extracts instead of Live connections.
Minimize the number of Quick Filters.
Use Aggregated Data (LOD calculations instead of complex calculations in SQL).
Reduce the number of marks on a visualization.
Optimize data source connections (avoid complex joins).
Minimize high-cardinality fields (e.g., avoid unique customer IDs in views).

9- What is a Reference Line, and how do you use it?

ANSWER:
A Reference Line is an annotation that helps compare values in a visualization.

Types of Reference Lines:

Constant Line: Fixed value (e.g., a goal of 10,000 sales).
Average Line: Shows the average value in the dataset.
Median Line: Displays the median value.
Dynamic Reference Line: Based on parameters.

10- What is the difference between a Treemap and a Heat Map?

ANSWER:
Treemap: Uses nested rectangles to represent hierarchical data with size and color.
Heat Map: Uses color intensity to show variations in a measure across two dimensions.

ANSWER:
