Advanced Tableau Interview Questions
For those aiming to excel in data visualization and business intelligence, mastering Tableau’s advanced functionalities is crucial.
The Advanced Tableau Interview Questions section focuses on complex topics such as LOD expressions (Fixed, Include, Exclude), data densification, performance tuning, row-level security (RLS), data scaffolding, and Tableau integration with Python/R. 
These advanced concepts help analysts work with large datasets efficiently and develop scalable, high-performance dashboards.
Employers highly value candidates who can solve complex analytical challenges, enhance user interactivity, and integrate Tableau with broader data ecosystems.

1- What is the difference between fixed, include, and Exclude LOD expressions?

ANSWER:
Level of Detail (LOD) expressions allow calculations at different levels of aggregation that what is displayed in the visualization
- Fixed: Computes at a specific level, ignoring filters (unless they are context filters)
- INCLUDE: includes additional dimensions in the aggregation, useful for more detailed calculations
- EXCLUDE: Removes specific dimensions from aggregation, useful for higher-level summaries

2- How do you perform data Densification in Tableau?

ANSWER:
Data Densification fills in missing data points in a dataset to create continuous visualizations
Techniques:
Show Missing Values: Right-click a date or bin and select "Show Missing Values" to fill gaps.
Use a Data Scaffold: Create a helper table to provide the missing values and join it with the original dataset.
Use INDEX() or LOOKUP() in Table Calculations: Helps fill missing data points.

3- What is the difference between a Data Extract and a Hyper Extract?

ANSWER:
- Data Extract (.tde): Tableau;s older extract format, optimized for speed but less efficient with large datasets.
- Hyper Extract(.hyper): the newer, more optimized format that handles larger datasets and faster performance

4- How do you handle large datasets and improve dashboard efficiency?

ANSWER:
Use Extracts instead of Live Connections (especially for slow databases).
Reduce Quick Filters and High-Cardinality Fields.
Use Aggregations & Calculated Fields efficiently.
Limit the number of marks (data points) on the view.
Optimize Joins and Blends (use relationships instead).
Enable Query Caching to speed up repeated queries.
Reduce Sheets in a Dashboard to improve load times.

5- How does Tableau handle NULL values, and how do you work around them?

ANSWER:
NULL values in Dimensions are shown as NULL in the view or removed if used in a filter.
On the other hand, Null values in Measures are treated as 0 in aggregations but ignored in calculations

6- What is a Data Scaffold, and when would you use it?

ANSWER:
A Data Scaffold is a secondary dataset that provides missing structure to fill gaps in the data
Data Scaffold can be used to fill in missing dates or categories, Enabling data densification when the original dataset is sparse, and supporting complex calculations that need additional data points.

7- Explain the concept of Data Aggregation in Tableau?

ANSWER:
Aggregation refers to combining multiple data points into a summary value

8- How do you create and use a Dynamic Parameter?

ANSWER:
A dynamic Parameter updates automatically based on changing data instead of requiring manual updates

9- How do you integrate Tableau with R or Python?

ANSWER:
Tableau can run R or Python scripts for advanced analytics using the TabPy (Tableau Python Server) or Rserve (for R integration).

10- How do you implement Row-Level Security (RLS) in Tableau?

ANSWER:
Row-Level Security (RLS) restricts data access based on user roles or login credentials.

Methods to Implement RLS:

User Filters in Tableau Server:
Create a calculation: USERNAME() = [AssignedUser].
Apply it as a filter.
Using Data Source Filters:
Define rules within a published data source.
Using a Security Table in the Database:
Create a mapping table (User → Allowed Regions).
Join it with the main data in Tableau.
